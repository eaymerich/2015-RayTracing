# 2015-RayTracing
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eaymerich/2015-RayTracing/master/Assign10-Path_Tracing/example.png)

Web-based ray tracer, accelerated using WebCL. This repository contains code develop for the course CAP-6721 Ray Tracing, at University of Central Florida.

Given the experimental nature of WebCL, this code requires a very specific platform: Firefox 34.0.5 with the Nokia WebCL extension (available at http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/). It also requires installed OpenCL drivers.
